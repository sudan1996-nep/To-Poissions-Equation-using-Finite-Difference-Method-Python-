This code solves Poisson's equation using the finite difference method to find the potential and electric field in a one-dimensional domain. The domain length, number of grid points, and average electron density are defined, and the grid spacing is calculated. The electric constant is also defined.

The potential and charge density arrays are initialized, and the left and right boundary conditions are defined as 0. The for loop then solves Poisson's equation iteratively 1000 times. The potential at interior points is updated using a central difference approximation, and the boundary conditions are applied at every iteration.

The electric field is then calculated by taking the gradient of the potential with respect to position using the numpy.gradient function. Two plots are then generated: one of the potential as a function of position, and the other of the electric field as a function of position. Both plots are labeled with the appropriate axis labels.
